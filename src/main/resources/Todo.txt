    Spring slices
    BaseDerived test classes
    RestTemplate.exchange
    WebClient
  API Test
    Identify method (POST, GET, etc.)
      MockMvc
      RestTemplate.exchange
      WebClient

Runner
  Run on multiple classes from specific root folder.

Reporting
  Export report to json (.csv?)
  Summary quality metrics
    total # of tests without asserts
    # of tests without asserts by type
    # of API tests with only one (status) assert
    # of API tests with one status and one field assert
    # of API/Unit with null assertions
    Derivative scores

    
Done:
  Identify valid tests in a test class.
  Identify exception tests (JUnit 4,5).
  Count asserts in each test (regular, Spring MockMvc)
  Identify ignored tests (JUnit 4,5).
